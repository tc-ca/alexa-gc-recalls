**alexa-gc-recalls** is a research project exploring how government services can be provided through voice interface. 
The Skill allows users to look up vehicle recall information found on Transport Canada [Safety Recalls website](http://wwwapps.tc.gc.ca/Saf-Sec-Sur/7/VRDB-BDRV/search-recherche/menu.aspx?lang=eng) through Alexa.
## Origin

This project got its start through the Governmentâ€™s OneGC Program Office which hosted an Alexa [proof-of-concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkA7NmMNpl4) for period of two weeks.

## Data Source

This Skill leverages [Open Data API](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/1ec92326-47ef-4110-b7ca-959fab03f96d) to retrieve vehicle recall information which can be query by users through Alexa.
